## Summary of Findings

In this exploration, I found there is a relation between higher income range and higher loan given amount, also owning a home or not affects the loan amount and borrower interest rate. I also found that most stated incomes are below $20,000 with most values between 2500 and 7500 a month. Term feature showed that most borrower prefer medium length loan terms over the other two sizes.

## Key Insights for Presentation

I will choose the Term countplot,the Estimated return distribution, the relation between income ranges and homeownership, and the multivariate relation of income range, loan term, and loan amount given.
